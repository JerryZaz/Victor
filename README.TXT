Victor was my final project for Udacity's Intro to java Nanodegree program.
The Project's package came with four preinstalled Agents, and the task
was to create an Agent that would play Connect4 and defeat the preinstalled agents.

The actual agent I presented as my final project is Vicky. Vicky was graded as
"Exceeds Expectations". The logic programmed in Vicky is able to defeat the
preinstalled "Advanced Agent" in 93% of the games.

After completing the Nanodegree I kept working on this project. Victor was born
with an idea, which evolved into something else, so when I finish it I'm most
likely to give it another name.

The programming on Victor checks out, it does what it's intended to do.
The problem is, that it'd take a few thousand years to complete the processing
so, if you're reading this, don't run Victor!!

In the main.java file, you'll find that Vicky is set to play both Red and Yellow.
If I've made some progress then some other Agent might be there, and if this readme
hasn't been updated, then this other Agent is not ready so you should probably set
both Agents to Vicky before running.
